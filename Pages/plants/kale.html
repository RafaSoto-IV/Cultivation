            - If you’re planting seeds, sow ¼ to ½ inch deep into well-drained, light soil.
<br />- After about 2 weeks, thin the seedlings so that they are spaced 8 to 12 inches apart. Kale likes to have plenty of space to stretch out.
<br />- If you’re setting out young plants (transplants), plant them at the depth at which they are growing in the container. Space 18 to 24 inches apart.
<br />- After planting, water plants well.

          <p>
            - It’s important to keep kale well watered and fed. If rain is inconsistent, provide 1 to 1.5 inches of water each week (about 1 gallon per square foot).
<br />- Regularly feed kale with a continuous-release plant food.
<br />- Mulch the soil to keep down the weeds and keep kale cool as kale won’t grow in hot weather.
<br />- Mulch the soil again heavily after the first hard freeze in the fall; the plants may continue to produce leaves throughout the winter.

          <p>
            - Kale is ready to harvest when the leaves are about the size of your hand.
<br />- Pick about one fistful of leaves per harvest. Start harvesting the oldest leaves firt from the lowest section of the plant. (Discard any yellowed or torn leaves.)
<br />- Avoid picking the terminal bud (found at the top center of the plant) because this will help to keep the plant productive.
<br />- Kale will continue growing until it’s 20°F. It tastes even sweeter with a touch of frost. (See local frost dates.)
<br />- If you wish to extend your harvest, shield your kale from the cold with row covers. Or, create a makeshift cover with tarps and old blankets propped up by hay bales. Here are a few more season-extending ideas.
<br />- The small, tender leaves can be eaten uncooked and used in salads.
<br />- Cut and cook the larger leaves like spinach, but be sure to remove the tough ribs before cooking.

            Recommended Varieties:
<br />- ‘Vates’, which is a hardy variety and does not yellow in cold weather. It also has curly, blue-green leaves.
<br />- ‘Winterbor’, which resembles the ‘Vates’ variety, but is frost tolerant.
<br />- ‘Red Russian’, which has red, tender leaves and is an early crop.
